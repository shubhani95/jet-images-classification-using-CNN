# jet-images-classification-using-CNN

In this study, we seek to utilize ML techniques to build a classifier for finding signs of new physics at the LHC using 2HDM Type-II. In particular, we will incorporate the advanced technique of image recognition by designing a CNN and visualizing what is ‘seen’ in a detector in particle physics experiments. Of course, there are well-established LHC searches using traditional techniques and alternative clustering algorithms for evaluating 2HDM final states. Here, we will deploy an image recognition-informed jet tagger’s exceptional ability to map the jet-level information to an image and distinguish signals from relevant backgrounds.

We will employ jet-level image recognition studies. In the context of boosted decays such that the entire signal event can be clustered into a single fat jet using a large cone size, and the big discriminatory feature for signal and background is the presence of a two-prong jet substructure, as done in the context of HSM → b b~ decay. For our study, we focus on b-jet final states from 2HDM Type-II with decay chains of the form gg → H → hh → bb~bb~. We also consider leading SM backgrounds, such as: gg,qq'→bb~bb~, gg, qq' → Zbb~, and gg, qq' → tt~.
